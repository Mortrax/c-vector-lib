# c-vector-lib
- An almost complete reverse engineering of the p5js vector API written in C.
- I wrote this library to enable myself to implement a genetic algorithm toy
  program called "smart rockets" that uses the Vector functionality to
  implement its physics. 
- This is based on a coding challenge by Daniel Schiffman
